Right now I set the field values outside the simulation domain to NaN.\nLess is more. Functions that are not directly relevant to tracing should not be placed in the main module.\nWrapperless: there is no need to build wrappers around well-documented functions from other packages; you just need to provide your specific methods. Simplicity is key.\nFor some unknown reasons, the results from analytic dipole field are not exactly the same under Linux, Mac and Windows.\nPlot.jl is really bad at 3D related plotting. I would hope Makie.jl performs better.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = TestParticle","category":"page"},{"location":"#TestParticle","page":"Home","title":"TestParticle","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Test particle tracing in a static electromagnetic field.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This package supports charged particle tracing in","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"an analytic electric and magnetic field, both relativistic and nonrelativistic;\na numeric electric and magnetic field.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"All tracing are done in 3D.
